            <h1>My Inspiration</h1>
            <p>Encouraging growth and sustainability together.</p>
            <p> This isn't just a website motto. I believe that together we can make anything happen. My continent is not the only one that needs this initiative though it needs it most.</p>
            <p> Many countries in Africa are war torn, some have corrupt leaders while in others the neo-colonialism leads to lack of resources, in turn, poverty knocks on doors with food insecurity in tow.
                This leads to suffering of many innocent young souls that could lead our continent into a better future so this inniciative is here to make sure this happens by helping to prevent malnutricition, hunger, starvation and death.
                With this I believe we can achieve "ZERO HUNGER" and help our future leaders to grow.</p>
            <p> Having said that, our continent is not the only one with these problems so we aim to reach out to all those in need and ensure a better healthier tomorrow.

        <h2>Here Are Some Reasons We Have Food Insecurity</h2>
        <div class="cause">
            <img src="images/lots of trash.jpg" alt="Land Pollution">
            <p>Uncontrolled dumping and burning of garbage affect soil health, the air we breathe and causes climate change</p>
        </div>
        <div class="cause">
            <img src="images1/trash in road.jpg" alt="Trash Pollution">
            <p>Heaps of waste pollute water sources and farmlands,making the land unable to produce crops and the environment unable to support any plants</p>
        </div>
        <div class="cause">
            <img src="images1/camp kid on head.jpg" alt="wars">
            <p>Wars also lead to displacement of people into overcrowded camps with limited supplies and this makes food insecurity imminent</p>
        </div>
        <div class="effect">
            <img src="images1/tractor on dry land.jpg" alt="poor farming methods">
            <p>Poor farming methods practiced by desparate farmers and rich pricks looking to pull a profit worsen the food situation</p>
        </div>
        <div class="effect">
            <img src="images1/dry maize.jpg" alt="wilted maize">
            <p>Climate change makes it harder for farmers to grow crops, worsening food insecurity</p>
        </div>
        <div class="effect">
            <img src="images1/sad kids  on dry land.jpg" alt="dry land">
            <p>With dry lands and limited sources of water for irrigation, well food insecurity is inevitable</p>
